# Svelte for Atom

Provides intellisense for Svelte components in Atom, utilising the [svelte language server](https://github.com/sveltejs/language-tools/tree/master/packages/language-server).

**This package does NOT ship with a Svelte grammar / syntax highlighting.** See [this doc](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte-atom/blob/master/docs/grammar.md) for up to date details and available solutions.

## Features

- TypeScript support in .svelte components
- Diagnostic messages for warnings and errors
- References & definitions provider

## Setup

### Configure Node executable

The Svelte Language Server that powers most of this plugins features uses some JS features that are not supported by the Node version embedded with Atom. That's why, to benefit from all features from the language server (loading of your project's `svelte.config.js` notably), the plugin tries to run the language server on your system's Node.

The default command the plugin uses to run Node is `node`, which will work if the Node.js executable is in your PATH and your PATH is visible to Atom. Otherwise you might need to customize this setting to provide the full path to a recent Node executable to be used to run the language server.

If no such Node executable can be found by the plugin, then it will fallback on using the Node embedded with Atom. But this will incurs feature loss and/or erratic behaviour of the language server.

### Ensure you have supporting plugins

This packages mainly only _exposes_ language features to be consumed by other plugins. It doesn't come with the supporting UI features that are expected to be provided by other "consumer" plugins.

Depending on your tastes, you can try the all inclusive [Atom IDE](https://ide.atom.io/) package, or try to compose for yourself a more personalized experience by hand picking and configuring a bunch of specialized plugins (Atom is all about hacking your IDE after all, isn't it?).

While assuming no endorsement, the following Atom packages have been used with some satisfaction for Svelte development in Atom by some of the authors of this plugin:

- **Linting**
  - [linter](https://atom.io/packages/linter)
  - [linter-ui-default](https://atom.io/packages/linter-ui-default)
- **TypeScript** While not strictly needed for TS support in Svelte components... Well, Svelte components are probably not going to make 100% of your app, and on the TS road, the more the better!
  - [atom-typescript](https://atom.io/packages/atom-typescript)
  - [language-typescript](https://atom.io/packages/language-typescript)
- **Info tooltips**
  - [atom-ide-datatip](https://atom.io/packages/atom-ide-datatip)
- **Navigate references/definitions**
  - [atom-refs](https://atom.io/packages/atom-refs) Still, no endorsment, but I can vouch for the author ^^ (full disclaimer: it's me).
- **Prettier**
  - [mprettier](https://atom.io/packages/mprettier) Hard & fast alternative to the official [prettier-atom](https://atom.io/packages/prettier-atom) plugin.
- **Emmet snippets**
  - [emmet](https://atom.io/packages/emmet)

### Grammar / syntax highlighting

You'll need a separate grammar package for syntax highlighting of Svelte files. Currently available options are the following:

- [language-svelte](https://atom.io/packages/language-svelte) A community maintained TextMate grammar for Svelte.
